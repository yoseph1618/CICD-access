  ## Description
  The CI/CD module leverages GitHub Actions to create an automated pipeline that ensures code quality and seamless deployment for a full-stack application. When a Pull Request is made to the develop branch, Cypress component tests are executed to validate the code, allowing developers to merge only after passing all quality checks. Upon merging to the main branch, the application is automatically deployed to Render, ensuring that updates are consistently and reliably reflected in production.
